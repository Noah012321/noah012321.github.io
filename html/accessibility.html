             <h2>Why is accessibility so important for a website?</h2>
               <p>
                Web accessibility serves as the cornerstone of an inclusive digital page. It revolves around the idea that every individual, 
                regardless of their abilities or disabilities, should have unrestricted access to online content. It's not merely a box to check for compliance, 
                but it's about acknowledging and respecting the diverse needs of users.
               </p>
               <p>
                Firstly, accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can navigate and engage with online content effortlessly. 
                Whether it's implementing screen reader compatibility for the visually impaired, keyboard navigation for those with motor impairments, 
                or providing captions for videos aiding the hearing impaired, these features bridge the gap between exclusion and full participation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Moreover, web accessibility extends its benefits beyond the disabled community. Clear, well-structured content and intuitive design, 
                integral to an accessible website, enhance the user experience for everyone. Think about how descriptive alt text not only assists 
                visually impaired users but also provides context for images that might not load correctly in various browsers or slow internet connections.
               </p>
               <p>
                The end goal of a well made website is it for not only to be accessible, but userfriendly. This was not something that was easy to do,
                especially sense we did not use any javascript, we used what we had and i believe we ended with a good result.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mainarticle">
                <h2>These are the steps we took to make our page more accessible</h2>
                <h3>HTML and CSS code</h3>
                  <p>
                   We added attributes like &lt;alt&gt;. This is a text-alternitive for none-text content. It allows people who can not see, to instead hear the alternative text (which is supposed to be descriptive of the none-text content).
                   It will also show the alternative text if the none-text content does not load properly.
                   We added  &lt;aria-label&gt; attribute which is used to give an accessible name when none is provided for interactive elements like hyperlink, you can see it being used on our scrollbutton.
                   We added the &lt;tabindex&gt; attribute. This allows people who are not able to use a mouse to navigate the webpage with more ease. We used it for the  
                   We added â€œ@media screen and (max-width: (x)px) which is a css attribute. It allows us to change the design on the webpage depending on the users screensize.
                   
                  </p>
                <h3>Webdesign and layout</h3>
                  <p>
                   Website design and layout also heavily effects the accessibility of a webpage. Color contrast is very important.
                   Color contrast between elements makes the elements more visible. Examples of this are text and background-color which you can see right here,
                   a white background and black text (This is what we have mostly used through our whole website). 
                   Our scroll-button has background-color which is in contrast with the color of the arrow,  ligh-grey backround, black arrow. 
                   We also chose to make our navigation-bar position: sticky; We believe that this raises accessibility because it gives the user the 
                   opportunity to access any part of the website at any time. We also added (read more) buttons which lessend the lenght
                   of some of our pages like the "About page". We felt that the page was very lengthy, so we used (read more) boxes to lessen the lengthiness.
                   On our "Fun?" page we did take a risk. We made a collapseble navigation-bar using only html and css. It would probaly turn out more estaticly pleasing by using javascript, but we really wanted to push our selfs and try to do something uniqe,
                   it was kinda the same thing with the "read more" box.
                   
                    
                  </p>
                <h3>Responsive design</h3>
                  <p>
                    Responsive design is vital part of a website. It allows people who use mobilephones and computers navigate through
                    the website with the same amount of ease. One of the biggest changes between the computerscreen() and a mobile screen
                    is that the navigation bar is vertical instead of horizontal, for small screen we wanted to utilize the limited space that it has
                    that's why we made the navbar dispay as block if screens are smaller than 600px wide. This also applies to different divs around the pages
                    such as articles where they will be displayed as block, where the imagess are vertically stacked under the articles rather horizontal. One of the reasons for 
                    this is, space limitation and image size. 
                  </p>
